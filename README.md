Azure Container Instances offers:

Azure provides an avenue for elastic compute to satisfy an unsteady influx of work. Many real world scenarios face this issue such as Black Friday retail websites, tax season for financial auditors, or consumer applications going viral. Azure Container Instances offers the ability to create fast, custom sized containers to respond to any workload that has been containerized. Simply define your container group with a docker image to get started.
